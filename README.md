pseudo_block_mode
=================

A sublime text plugin that fills out the whole file with whitespace so that block mode editing and text overwriting gets easier.
Especially useful when working with old programming languages like `COBOL` or `PL1`.

Features
---
- Block mode: The complete file is filled with whitespace aligning with the longest line of the file.
- Align cursor at end: When having multiple cursors or a selection over multiple lines you can fill out those lines with whitespace in a rectangle manner. For every line a cursor will be created and put positioned at the end of the line.

Usage
---
- Toggle block mode (all OS): `Alt+Shift+A` (Or over command palette)
- Enter Block Mode: Command palette or `Edit -> Pseudo Block Mode -> Enter block mode`
- Exit Block Mode: Command palette or `Edit -> Pseudo Block Mode -> Enter block mode`
- Align cursor at end: Command palette or `Edit -> Pseudo Block Mode -> Align cursors at end`
